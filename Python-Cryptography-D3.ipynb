This is different than the substitution cipher, as the block cipher converts an entire _block_ of characters vs. converting each character individually. This is useful, as it complicates attacks wherein someone tries to guess the key by evaluating different potential keys using the characters in a message.\n",

The library is used to generate a random key that is of a particularly long byte size. This key is then used to encrypt the plain text message, which has been converted into bytes (Line 13). \n",

    "This example is more like real-world cryptography than the others we have investigated thus far, in part because the other ciphers are not as useful in real-world cryptography due to their relative weakness. Here, the key generated is a 32-byte encryption key, which is used in AES-256 encryption. AES-256 encryption is a standard encryption method accepted by the National Institute of Standards and Technology. \n",
    "\n",
    "It is useful to note that abstraction is being used in the code block below. Notice that the ciphertext is produced by a command (cipher.encrypt) -- which has abstracted away some of the elements we see in other code blocks, such as padding to ensure the plain text message is a multiple of the key length.
